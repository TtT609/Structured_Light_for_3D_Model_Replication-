## Credits & Attribution
This project incorporates core 3D scanning algorithms adapted from:
* **Project**: Structured Light for 3D Scanning
* **Author**: Douglas Lanman (Brown University)
* **Contribution**: The Gray code generation and ray-plane triangulation logic in /core/scanner.py is a Python port of the original Matlab implementation by Lanman.
